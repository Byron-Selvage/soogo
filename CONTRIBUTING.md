# Contributing guidelines

Thank you for investing your precious time to contribute to this project. Please read the following guidelines before contributing.

## Code style

This project uses [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) to enforce code style. Ruff is a wrapper around [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/). To use Ruff, run `ruff check` at the root of this repository to see if there are formatting fixes to be performed. Then run `ruff format` to format the code. Run `ruff --help` to see the available options.
